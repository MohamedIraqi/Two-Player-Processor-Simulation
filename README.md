# Two-Player-Processor-Simulation
 
# CMP2010 Microprocessor Systems I Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the CMP2010 Microprocessor Systems I project completed at Cairo University, focusing on the development of a two-player simulation game and chat application using assembly language.

## Overview

The CMP2010 project involved connecting two PCs through a simple network using serial communication. It comprised two main functionalities:

1. **Chatting**: Users could communicate with each other via a chat interface, allowing text-based conversations over the network. The chat feature included scrolling functionality and a notification system for chat invitations.

2. **Processor Simulation Game**: This two-player game aimed to write specific values into opponent registers. Players could send game invitations, choose game levels, and utilize special powers to hinder their opponent's progress.

## Features

- **Connection Mechanism**: PCs were connected via serial ports for communication.
- **Usernames**: Users provided their usernames for identification in chat and games.
- **Main Screen**: A graphical main screen displayed available functionalities and notifications.
- **Chatting**: Text-based chat with scrolling functionality.
- **Processor Simulation Game**: A two-player game with different levels, power-ups, and strategies.
- **User Interface**: Unique user interfaces designed for the game and chat features.

## Project Phases

The project was divided into two phases:

1. **Phase 1: Two Players Game at one PC**: An initial version of the game without the communication module.
2. **Phase 2: Full Project Delivery**: A complete version of the project, including communication and game features.

## Getting Started
